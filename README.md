## **Completed Projects**
### [Anti-Gambling Website](https://github.com/jinzalabim/OTHER-PROJECTS/tree/main/Anti-Gambling%20Website) 
<img src="images/1.png" alt="Anti-Gambling Website" width="200" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px;"> Created a **demo website** as part of my final assignment for the **Cyberspace, Organizations, and Communities (OSDCYOC A52)** class. The site simulates an online casino experience to highlight the **risks** and **ethical concerns** of online gambling. After engaging with casino-style games, users are redirected to an informational page detailing the dangers of **gambling addiction**, **online casino risks**, and available resources for help. The website was deployed on **Vercel** and features interactive game iframes from **PragmaticPlay**.

### [Gradient Boosting from Scratch](https://github.com/jinzalabim/DATA103-MACHINE-LEARNING/tree/main/Gradient%20Boosting%20From%20Scratch)
Built a custom implementation of **Gradient Boosting** to demonstrate the algorithm's core concepts, including **additive modeling**, **gradient computation**, and **loss minimization**. This project showcases a step-by-step approach to building machine learning algorithms from the ground up, emphasizing a deeper understanding of **Gradient Boosting** while comparing its performance with library-based solutions.

### [Facebook Viewbot](https://github.com/jinzalabim/OTHER-PROJECTS/tree/main/Facebook%20Automated%20Views)
Created an automated Facebook Viewbot leveraging **Selenium** to simulate user interactions with Facebook posts. This project demonstrates browser automation techniques, including login automation and post navigation, emphasizing the **ethical implications** of automated engagement manipulation. Designed strictly for **educational purposes**.

### [Explainability Methods for Machine Learning Models: Telco Churn Dataset](https://github.com/jinzalabim/DATA103-MACHINE-LEARNING/tree/main/Explainability%20Methods%20for%20Telco%20Churn)
Implemented and explored various **explainability methods** (**SHAP**, **LIME**, **PDP**) for a **Random Forest** classifier trained on the **Telco Churn** dataset. The project focused on understanding the key features influencing churn predictions and providing **model transparency**. Key findings included identifying the top features with the most significant impact on the model's decisions, offering valuable insights for improving customer retention strategies.

### [Python Refresher for Non-CS Majors](https://github.com/jinzalabim/OTHER-PROJECTS/tree/main/Python%20Refresher)
Developed as part of my **DATA103** class, this **Python refresher** notebook is designed for individuals without a computer science background. It covers fundamental programming concepts, data manipulation using **pandas** and **numpy**, and data visualization with **matplotlib** and **plotly**, offering an accessible introduction to Python for transitioning into technical fields.

### [Lotto Prediction System Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/jinzalabim/OTHER-PROJECTS/tree/main/Lotto%20Draws%20PH)
This project uses **Random Forest Classifiers** to predict the most probable winning numbers for a lottery based on historical draw data. The system analyzes features such as **month**, **day**, and **day of the week** from past draws, and it updates dynamically as new results are added. While the model provides insights into potential patterns, predicting lottery outcomes is inherently random. This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in predicting outcomes based on historical trends.

## **Current Projects**

### **Credit Scoring Project**
Currently finalizing a **credit scoring project** involving a comprehensive machine learning workflow. The project includes **data preparation**, **model training**, and **evaluation** using a variety of techniques. The goal is to predict **creditworthiness** based on a dataset with 150,000 entries, incorporating both **categorical** and **numerical** data. The project emphasizes **model performance interpretation**, **feature selection**, and the application of techniques like **hyperparameter tuning** and **cross-validation** to ensure accurate and reliable predictions.

### **AO3 Recommender System**
Currently working on an **AO3 recommender system** using **machine learning** in my free time. The project involves developing a **hybrid filtering method** to recommend **fanfiction** based on user preferences and behaviors. It includes tasks like **data preprocessing**, **model training**, and fine-tuning the algorithm for optimal recommendations on **archiveofourown.org**.
